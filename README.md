# data-analytics-seb

This project was created by me and my friend Rahul because we wanted to visualise our expenses more nicely and thoroughly. 

We take the CSV file of our account statement from SEB and then do analysis on it. 

I will open source the project now.

We want to create this because SEB App visualisation misses a lot of things and doesn't give comprehensive review of spending.
